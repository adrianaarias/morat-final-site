  Morat is a Colombian band formed in the country's capital city, Bogotá. The band is formed by Juan Pablo Isaza (guitars and vocals), Juan Pablo Villamil (banjo and vocals) and the brothers Simón Vargas (bass and choruses) and Martín Vargas (percussion and choirs). Previously, until the end of 2016, drummer Alejandro Posada had been in the band, but the percussionist had to leave the project. He was replaced by Martín Vargas. The members of Morat have known each other since they were 5 years old. They all studied together at the La Montaña Gymnasium in Bogotá, and some of them at Los Andes' University.

  The band's original name was "Malta". The name was inspired by a pet owned by Isaza. They switched to "Morat" because it was the surname of an ancestor of Alejandro Posada, former member of the band. The name was also inspired by the farm where the band made their first rehearsals which was named "La Morat": They began to stand out internationally with their 2015 hit single "Mi Nuevo Vicio" in collaboration with Paulina Rubio. The single was certified platinum, became their first digital number one in Spain and earned a number one in air play in Mexico. At the end of 2015 they recieved international success thanks to the realease of a new single called "Cómo te atreves", which reached the peak position in iTunes and brought them to fame in Spain. Following their 2015 almost inmediate success; they released in June 2016 their first studio album Sobre el amor y sus efectos secundarios through Universal Music. The album debuted number one in several hispanic countries such as Colombia, Mexico or Spain.
